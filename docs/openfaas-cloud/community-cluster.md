The OpenFaaS Cloud Community Cluster is a hosted version of OpenFaaS Cloud. The OpenFaaS Cloud Community Cluster is currently free and is the easiest way to try out OpenFaaS without having to set up anything yourself.

You can request access, and if accepted you will be able to deploy functions using the OpenFaaS templates or microservices using a Dockerfile.

When you have your access, you'll get:

* Your own personal dashboard
* Built-in CI/CD for private and public repos
* Auto-scaling
* Metrics for each function
* HTTPS endpoints
* Detailed build logs
* Personal sub-domain
