The OpenFaaS Cloud Community Cluster is a hosted version of [OpenFaaS Cloud](/openfaas-cloud/intro/). The OpenFaaS Cloud Community Cluster is free to use and probably the quickest and easiest way to try out OpenFaaS. You don't have to set up any servers or even think about Docker, or Kubernetes.

You can request access, and if accepted you will be able to deploy functions using the OpenFaaS templates or microservices using a Dockerfile.

When you have your access, you'll get:

* Your own personal dashboard
* Built-in CI/CD for private and public repos
* Auto-scaling
* Metrics for each function
* HTTPS endpoints
* Detailed build logs
* Personal sub-domain

You can apply for access using a Google Form and applications are usually processed within 72 hours:
